		<h2 id ="subject"> Subject </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this lab is to get us to look back at our code and fix whatever may be wrong with it.
		Whether it be isolating pieces to see waht is wrong, or even takeing out pieces to see if errors appear. </p>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p>I keep having trouble with getting the Java  script Output to show up. I try, but I can't get it
		appear. I have followed it to a "T", and still cant get it too show up. Its working, just not the way I want it too.	<p>

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<h4>Debugging</h4>
			<p>All labs are working, save for the ones whose outputs are not showing up. No idea how to fix them.<p>
