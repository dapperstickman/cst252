		<h2> Subject </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this lab is to get us familiar with psuedocoding a task.
			To help us make an outline of what we want to do before we do it so that
			we don't trip over our own work.
		A step-by-step process on how we want a task done.</p>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p>The lab rules were a bit fuzzy. I was a bit unsure on how we were to do things.
			The rules were a bit confusing at first, but me and my partner ventually
			figured it out. it also took a bit of time to figure out what task to be preformed.<p>
