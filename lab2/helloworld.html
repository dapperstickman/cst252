			<h1>Challenges</h1>
						<p>What's up, back at it again with using CSS & HTML. I would like this comeback to be nice and flashy,
							 but I'll probably just be using old code to get me back. I am Phillip Guaracha. I am from San Juan Bautista and I am a sophmore at CSUMB.
							  I am a Communication Design major with a focus on Game Design. My partner is Jeremy Jacob Francisco, a true gamer. He's from Marina.
								He is also a sophmore at CSUMB, and together we are ballin CD Majors.</p>
			<h1>Problems</h1>
					<p>It's another lab, which means trying to remember how I did things. Nothing too hard, but still things to be careful of.
						 Gotta keep an eye out for mislabeling, mislinking, like I did back in 251. If somethings out of place it won't work.
						 Since its old code there shouldn't be too much issue.</p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>This website looks ok for a comeback. I use nothig fancy since it is just a comeback. Even in that class I only undertood a bit.
				Used some basic border, shadow, and text changers. AS well as a background gif.</p>
